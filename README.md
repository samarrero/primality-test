natural numbers, composite numbers, and prime numbers, oh my!

## playing around with primality test algorithms

### list of algorithms:

#### brute force (prime until proven not)
- given an integer *n*, this method goes through a range of integers *(1, n)* and determines which are factors of *n*.
- if *n* has more factors than 1 and itself, then *n* is composite.
  - pro: accurate
  - con: slow
